# Interfaces

- It is a collection of unimplemented methods that a class must implement.

## Rules

- Fields in an interface are public, static and final implicitly. You need to make the constant
- An interface cannot extend a class, but it can extend another interface.
- Java 8, an interface can have default methods and static methods

Static vs Default methods
